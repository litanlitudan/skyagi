	>SkyAGI: Emerging human-behavior simulation capability in LLM</Heading
>

<P class="px-8 py-4">
	SkyAGI is a python package that demonstrates LLM's emerging capability in simulating believable
	human behaviors. Specifically, SkyAGI implements the idea of Generative Agents and delivers a
	role-playing game that creates a very interesting user experience.
</P>
<P class="px-8 py-4">
	Different from previous AI based NPC systems, SkyAGI's NPC generates very believable human
	responses. The interesting observations in this demo show a huge potential for rethinking game
	development in many aspects, such as NPC script writing.
</P>
<P class="px-8 py-4">
	To demonstrate this, SkyAGI provides example characters from The Big Bang Theory and The Avengers
	as a starting point. Users could also define customized characters by creating config json files
